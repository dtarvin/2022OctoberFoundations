            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 
                1983 with a simple premise: Free software for a free world. From the 
                beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that vision 
                has never wavered.

                    Kent Smotherman has 38 years of professional development 
                    experience using over a dozen programming languages. He enjoys 
                    teaching web development, chess, and petting the family cat, 
                    Solo (obviously), though he is not a Bond villain.

                    TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations. We will work with you 
                    to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications are all about data, and without deeply 
                    understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
            <p>
                Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web application is a web site powered by a 
                database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user and can change every single second.

            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>
                We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally lost count! Applications like our 
                FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as is our productivity suite for GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s for not just 
                conferencing, but online learning. Our Android applications range from custom games to productivity tools. Web sites and 
                applications? We've done 'em by the dozens.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, it's a hardware problem!

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 
                1983 with a simple premise: Free software for a free world. From the 
                beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that vision 
                has never wavered.

                    experience using over a dozen programming languages. He enjoys 
                    teaching web development, chess, and petting the family cat, 
                    Solo (obviously), though he is not a Bond villain.
